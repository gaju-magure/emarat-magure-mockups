# Emarat AI ‚Äî Product & Implementation Plan (Concise, Updated Layout)

> Updated structure focusing on **three-column layout** (Left Sidebar / Center Jarvis / Right Sidebar)

---

## Overall Layout (Web + Mobile First)

**Mobile:** collapses to bottom tab bar (Jarvis center only visible, others slide-in)

**Desktop:** full three-column view

### 1. Left Sidebar (Navigation)

> Minimal, persistent, icon-first vertical bar

| Nav Item       | Icon | Function                                                                       |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Apps           | üß©   | Opens list of all use cases (RFP, Forecasting, Recruitment, Invoice, Insights) |
| Task Dashboard | ‚úÖ   | Opens assigned tasks, approvals, due dates                                     |
| Governance     | ‚öôÔ∏è | Access to model registry, audit trails, logs                                   |
| You            | üë§   | User profile, preferences, logout                                              |

* Expandable (hover or click) on desktop.
* Collapses to icons-only by default.
* On mobile, becomes bottom tab bar.

---

### 2. Center ‚Äî Jarvis (Main AI Surface)

> Central ‚ÄúJarvis‚Äù AI ‚Äî simple, no fancy animation, but powerful contextual content.

**Sections:**

* **Greeting block** ‚Äì ‚ÄúGood morning, [Name]. Here‚Äôs what matters today.‚Äù
* **Floating items** ‚Äì alerts, pending approvals, quick reminders (context-aware)
* **Chat area** ‚Äì input + threaded responses
* **Quick Actions** ‚Äì shortcuts (‚ÄúShow my RFP evaluations‚Äù, ‚ÄúReconcile last week‚Äôs invoices‚Äù)
* **Highlights Feed** ‚Äì cards summarizing KPIs, insights, and forecasts

**Rules:**

* Keep layout clean and functional.
* Use floating cards for attention-seeking info (alerts, tasks).
* Role-aware ‚Äî feed and alerts change by role (Procurement, Finance, HR, etc.)

---

### 3. Right Sidebar (Extended Content Area)

> Used for context, related data, and additional insights.

**Possible uses:**

* Recently viewed items
* Related insights / quick metrics
* Collaboration notes or comments
* Action confirmations (‚ÄúTask created successfully‚Äù)
* Optional widgets (calendar, reminders, etc.)

**Behavior:**

* Fixed width (~320px on desktop)
* Collapses entirely on mobile
* Opens on-demand if user expands insight or clicks related data

---

## Design Philosophy

* **Functional minimalism:** no animations or distractions
* **Mobile-first:** center-first layout; sidebars hidden by default
* **Dynamic theme injection:** use Tailwind tokens (no hardcoding)
* **Role-aware content:** every visible element adapts to user‚Äôs context

---

## Next Step Options

1. Generate React layout (LeftBar, CenterJarvis, RightBar components)
2. Provide `tailwind.config.js` + token-based theme.json for styling
3. Wire mock data (alerts, tasks, insights) for Jarvis center

---

Select which next step to generate ‚Äî layout code, theme config, or mock data wiring ‚Äî and I‚Äôll output it compactly.
